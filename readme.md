# Iromlab

## What it does

Iromlab (Image and Rip Optical Media Like A Boss ) provides a simple and straightforward way to save the content of offline optical media from the KB collection. It currently supports the following carrier types:

- CD-ROM
- DVD (includes DVD-ROM, DVD-Video and DVD-Audio) 
- Audio CD
- 'Enhanced'(Blue Book) CD
- Mixed mode CD
- Philip CD-Interactive

Internally Iromlab wraps around a number of widely-used software tools. Iromlab automatically detects the carrier type, including whether it contains data, audio, or a comination of both. The content of data sessions is extracted and saved as an ISO image using [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/). For audio sessions all tracks are ripped to WAV or FLAC format with [dBpoweramp](https://www.dbpoweramp.com/). Iromlab supports both 'enhanced' audio CDs that contain both audio and data sessions, as well as 'Mixed mode' discs, which contain 1 session that holds both audio and data tracks. Data from Philip CD-Interactive discs is saved as a raw binary image.

ISO images are verified using [Isolyzer](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/isolyzer). Audio files are checked for errors using [shntool](http://www.etree.org/shnutils/shntool/) (WAV format) or [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) (FLAC format).

The disc images/rips are saved in a simple batch structure. Each batch contains a batch manifest, which is a comma-delimited text file with basic information about each carriers, such as:

- An identifier that links to a record in the KB catalogue.
- A volume number (because carriers may span multiple volumes).
- A True/False flag that indicates the status of iromlab's imaging/ripping process.
- A series of True/False flags that indicate the presence of audio, data, or particular CD layouts (e.g. CD-extra, mixed mode, of cd-interactive).

These batches can be further processed into ingest-ready Submission Information Packages using [omSipCreator](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/omSipCreator).

## Using Iromlab outside the KB

By default, Iromlab expects each carrier to be associated with a record in the KB catalogue by means of an identifier (PPN). This identifier is then used to fetch title information from the KB catalogue using a HTTP request. This effectively constrains the use of Iromlab to materials in the KB collection. To overcome this constraint, you can disable the PPN lookup by setting the value of *enablePPNLookup* in the configuration file to *False*. More details can be found in the [setup and configuration documentation](./doc/setupIromlab.md#enableppnlookup). If *enablePPNLookup* is disabled, the *PPN* data entry widget in Iromlab's data entry GUI is replaced with a *Title* widget, which can be used for entering a free text description of each carrier. See also the section about [Processing discs that are not part of the KB collection](./doc/userGuide.md#processing-discs-that-are-not-part-of-the-kb-collection) in the User Guide.

Moreover, it would be fairly straightforward to replace the PPN lookup by some alternative identifier that is linked to another catalogue/database (especially if it can be queried using HTTP-requests).

Also, Iromlab is based on a pretty specific hardware/software setup (see sections below). However, most of the software dependencies are implemented using simple wrapper modules, so this is also something that could be modified quite easily.

## Platform

MS Windows only. It may be possible to adapt the software to other platforms.

## Hardware dependencies

Iromlab was created to be used in conjuction with Acronova Nimbie disc autoloaders. It has been tested with the [Nimbie NB21-DVD model](http://www.acronova.com/product/auto-blu-ray-duplicator-publisher-ripper-nimbie-usb-nb21/9/review.html). It may work with other models as well.

## Wrapped software

Iromlab wraps around a number of existing software tools:

* [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/) (note: Iromlab needs version 4.1 or more recent!) 
* dBpoweramp, dBpoweramp Batch Ripper and Nimbie Batch Ripper Driver; all available [from the dBpoweramp website](https://www.dbpoweramp.com/batch-ripper.htm). (Note: Iromlab wraps dBpoweramp's Nimbie driver binaries to control the disc loading / unloading process.)
* [cd-info](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cd-info) - this tool is part of [libcdio](https://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/),  the "GNU Compact Disc Input and Control Library".
* [shntool](http://www.etree.org/shnutils/shntool/) - used to verify the integrity of created WAVE files.
* [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) - used to verify the integrity of created WAVE files.

Both IsoBuster and dBpoweramp require a license, and they must be installed separately. Binaries of cd-info, shntool and flac are included in the iromlab installation, and they are automatically copied to the iromlab package directory during the setup process.
