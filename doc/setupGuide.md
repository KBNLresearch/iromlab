# Iromlab Setup Guide

Before trying to set up Iromlab, check if the following requirements are met:

* The installation platform is Microsoft Windows (tested with Windows 7). Other platforms (e.g. Linux-based one) will not work properly, because various parts of the code are Windows-specific.
* Python 3.6 (or more recent) is installed on the target platform. Older 3.x versions may (but are not guaranteed to) work.
* Since Iromlab uses the [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/) and [dBpoweramp](https://www.dbpoweramp.com/) software for data extraction and audio ripping, licensed copies of both software packages must be available.
* Iromlab was created to be used in conjuction with Acronova Nimbie disc autoloaders. It has been tested with the [Nimbie NB21-DVD model](http://www.acronova.com/product/auto-blu-ray-duplicator-publisher-ripper-nimbie-usb-nb21/9/review.html). It may work with other models as well.

Getting Iromlab up running requires a number of installation and configuration steps:

1. Install Isobuster
2. Configure Isobuster to make it play nicely with Iromlab
3. Install dBpoweramp
4. Configure dBpoweramp
5. Install Iromlab
6. Configure Iromlab 

This is a bit tedious, but you only have to do this once. Each step is described in detail below.
