shntool for DOS/Windows
-----------------------

shntool was built as a native DOS/Windows console application using the MinGW
toolkit, available at <http://www.mingw.org/>.

Support for various file formats is available by downloading the appropriate
win32 helper program linked from the shntool webpage.


============
Installation
============

To install shntool, first extract the files contained in the distribution .zip
file to a temporary directory, and copy shntool.exe to any directory that is
in your PATH.  To find out what directories are in your PATH, open a DOS prompt
and type:

  C:\> echo %PATH%

Any of the listed directories will do, but perhaps the best choice is one of the
Windows directories, e.g. C:\Windows, C:\Windows\Command, C:\Windows\System,
C:\WinNT, C:\WinNT\System32, et cetera.  Of course, yours may be different than
these, and there may be more than one Windows directory listed.

To make sure shntool working correctly, go to the DOS prompt and type:

  C:\> shntool -v

If that doesn't work, you may need to add the extension:

  C:\> shntool.exe -v

You should see shntool's version information (verify that it shows the correct
version - if not, then you probably have an outdated copy of shntool.exe
somewhere on your hard drive that you need to remove).  If you don't see the
version information, or if you get a message saying that the command was not
found, then shntool is not installed correctly.

After you are sure that shntool is installed correctly, you can install any of
the helper programs listed above by copying them to the same directory in which
shntool.exe resides.


=====
Usage
=====

To use shntool, simply invoke it from a DOS prompt as follows:

  C:\> shntool

modes, see the shntool.txt or shntool.pdf files included in this distribution.
